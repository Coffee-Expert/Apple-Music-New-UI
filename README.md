# Apple Music Clone Using Flutter

Welcome to the Apple Music Clone project! This project is a demonstration of building a music player interface and functionality using Flutter, focusing on managing and playing local audio files. It's an excellent resource for developers interested in creating a music streaming application without relying on external APIs, using local sample audio for demonstration purposes.

## Who Is This For?

- **Flutter Developers:** Enhance your skills in media playback, state management, and advanced UI development.
- **UI/UX Designers:** Experiment with recreating or innovating on the user interfaces of popular music streaming services, focusing on user experience.
- **Students and Educators:** A valuable educational tool for learning app development, covering local file access, media control, and state management in Flutter.
- **Hobbyists:** Perfect for tech enthusiasts interested in combining their love for music with app development, without the complexities of backend integration.

## Key Features

- **Local Audio Playback:** Play audio files stored within the app.
- **Music Library Navigation:** Smooth navigation through a music library.
- **Playback Controls:** Includes essential features like play, pause, skip, and shuffle.
- **Coffee-Expert Flavoured:** I have made some redesigns to the official Apple Music UI (Hope u like it!).
